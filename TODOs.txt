known situation:
1. test and train data misalignment, alot of missing area
2. majority voting system still implement 4/9 threshold
3. accuracy in train and test seems different due to unkown issue

INVESTIGATION:
WARNING : 1.the heterogeneity of polygon gscore (most gscore(77%) is 0, with only 4% positive and 18.52% negative)


Action Points:
TODO(CRITICAL):





TODO(FUTURE):
1. checkpoint system is deprecated, need to re-design
2. Rewrite Agent documentations  according to standard, private domain engineering wiki.
3. Restructure documents.
4. GeoXGB test pipeline is not producing all the required figures

IMPORTANT NOTE
for one round:
parent RF -> using the parent RF validation/train to calculate groupwise metrics -> partition (LTSS/q) -> 
partition contiguity refinement -> child model using child model specific validation/train -> child model performance metrics -> partition significance test ->
 in RF, can also copy parent RF weights to one of the child RF
