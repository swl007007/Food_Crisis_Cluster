known situation:
1. test and train data misalignment, alot of missing area
2. majority voting system still implement 4/9 threshold
3. accuracy in train and test seems different due to unkown issue

INVESTIGATION:
WARNING : 1.the heterogeneity of polygon gscore (most gscore(77%) is 0, with only 4% positive and 18.52% negative)


Action Points:
TODO(CRITICAL):
2.use 4-8-12 months lag instead of 3-6-8-12 months lag throughout the pipeline

4.solve accuracy map axis name issue

concurrent:
7.think about the architecture of two layer model



TODO(FUTURE):
2.use ChatGPT to parse pre-2017 locations to country ISO and admin1 codes


IMPORTANT NOTE
for one round:
parent RF -> using the parent RF validation/train to calculate groupwise metrics -> partition (LTSS/q) -> 
partition contiguity refinement -> child model using child model specific validation/train -> child model performance metrics -> partition significance test ->
 in RF, can also copy parent RF weights to one of the child RF
