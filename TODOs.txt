known situation:
1. test and train data misalignment, alot of missing area
2. majority voting system still implement 4/9 threshold
3. accuracy in train and test seems different due to unkown issue

INVESTIGATION:
WARNING : 1.the heterogeneity of polygon gscore (most gscore(77%) is 0, with only 4% positive and 18.52% negative)


Action Points:
TODO(CRITICAL):



TODO(on hold):
1.remove lat and lon 1min
2. remove year variable and quarter variable(gradually remove) 1min
3. smaller feature set of ~20 variables 1min
4.further processing on shap values 10min






TODO(FUTURE):
1. checkpoint system is deprecated, need to re-design
2. GeoXGB test pipeline is not producing all the required figures
3. Rewrite Agent documentations  according to standard, private domain engineering wiki.
4.write out features that need unit tests, complete unit tests and complete feature tests/integration reports


IMPORTANT NOTE
for one round:
parent RF -> using the parent RF validation/train to calculate groupwise metrics -> partition (LTSS/q) -> 
partition contiguity refinement -> child model using child model specific validation/train -> child model performance metrics -> partition significance test ->
 in RF, can also copy parent RF weights to one of the child RF
