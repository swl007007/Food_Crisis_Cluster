known situation:
1. test and train data misalignment, alot of missing area
2. majority voting system still implement 4/9 threshold
3. accuracy in train and test seems different due to unkown issue

INVESTIGATION:
WARNING : 1.the heterogeneity of polygon gscore (most gscore(77%) is 0, with only 4% positive and 18.52% negative)


Action Points:
TODO(CRITICAL):
2. for georf and geoxgboost, in the main pipeline skip all baseline cross validation etc.
3. for geoxgboost, clarify the output name




TODO(FUTURE):
1. Rewrite Agent documentations  according to standard, private domain engineering wiki.

IMPORTANT NOTE
for one round:
parent RF -> using the parent RF validation/train to calculate groupwise metrics -> partition (LTSS/q) -> 
partition contiguity refinement -> child model using child model specific validation/train -> child model performance metrics -> partition significance test ->
 in RF, can also copy parent RF weights to one of the child RF
