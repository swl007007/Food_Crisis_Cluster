# Legacy Documentation Folder

**Status:** DEPRECATED - Content migrated to `.ai/` directory
**Migration Date:** 2025-01-17
**Purpose:** Reference and backup only

## What's Here

This folder contains **backup and reference files only**. All active documentation has been migrated to the `.ai/` directory.

### Files Retained:

1. **`_MIGRATION_NOTICE.md`** - Guide to new documentation structure
2. **`Feature_Test_Doc/varlist.xlsx`** - Backup of variable definitions (active copy in `.ai/docs/features/`)
3. **`Test_Doc/error_rate_extract_report*.json`** - Historical error rate analysis reports
4. **`Technical_Assesment_Doc/refactoring_report.json`** - Historical refactoring analysis

## Where to Find Active Documentation

## Why Was This Migrated?

The new `.ai/` structure provides:
1. **Issue-based organization** - Clear tracking of problems and solutions
2. **Eliminated redundancy** - Single source of truth
3. **Better discoverability** - Consistent folder structure
4. **Status tracking** - Each issue has explicit status
5. **AI-friendly** - Structured for AI assistant navigation

## Can This Folder Be Deleted?

**Not recommended yet.** Keep for:
- Backup of varlist.xlsx
- Reference to historical JSON reports
- Safety during transition period (1-2 months)

After confirming the new structure works well, you can:
1. Archive this folder outside the repository
2. Or delete it entirely
