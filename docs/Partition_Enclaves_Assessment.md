# Partition Enclaves Assessment Report

## Executive Summary

**Finding**: The enclave-like polygons observed in contiguity-based partition maps are **expected behavior**, not bugs requiring fixes. They result from a conservative 4/9 majority voting threshold in the contiguity refinement algorithm that intentionally prevents excessive partition switching.

**Key Insight**: The current system uses true polygon adjacency matrices (not distance-based neighbors) with a conservative threshold that creates stable spatial equilibria, preserving both algorithmic enclaves and true geographic enclaves.

## Technical Analysis

### Actual Neighbor Detection Method

**Configuration Status:**
- `USE_ADJACENCY_MATRIX = True` in both `config.py` and `config_visual.py`
- System uses true polygon boundary relationships from FEWS NET admin boundaries shapefile
- **Distance-based neighbors are NOT used** in current production configuration

**Code Flow:**
1. `get_refined_partitions_polygon()` (partition_opt.py:758-761)
   - Extracts `adjacency_dict` from `polygon_group_mapping`
   - Passes to `get_polygon_neighbors()`

2. `get_polygon_neighbors()` (partition_opt.py:536-539)
   - **When `adjacency_dict` is provided**: Uses true adjacency matrix
   - **Fallback only**: Uses distance-based calculation if adjacency unavailable
   - Logs: "Using true polygon adjacency matrix for neighbor determination"

3. `swap_partition_polygon()` (partition_opt.py:624-628)
   - Applies 4/9 majority voting threshold to neighbor relationships

### Enclave Formation Mechanism: The 4/9 Threshold

**Primary Cause**: Conservative majority voting rule in `swap_partition_polygon()`:

```python
# Lines 624-628: The enclave-preserving logic
if current_partition_count / total_count < 4/9:
    majority_partition = 1 - current_partition  # Switch partition
else:
    majority_partition = current_partition      # Keep current partition
```

**How Enclaves Form:**

1. **Stable Equilibrium**: A polygon surrounded by opposite-partition neighbors will only switch if it represents < 44.4% of the voting population
2. **Self-Preservation**: Since the polygon votes for itself, it needs only 1-2 like-minded neighbors out of 5-6 total to stay in its current partition
3. **Conservative Threshold**: The 4/9 threshold (vs 50%) creates resistance to partition switching

**Mathematical Example:**
- Polygon A (partition 0) has 4 neighbors all in partition 1
- Voting population: A(0) + 4 neighbors(1) = 1 vote for 0, 4 votes for 1
- A's partition proportion: 1/5 = 20% < 44.4% → A switches to partition 1
- But if A has just 1 like-minded neighbor: 2/6 = 33.3% < 44.4% → A still switches
- If A has 2 like-minded neighbors: 3/7 = 42.9% < 44.4% → A still switches  
- If A has 3 like-minded neighbors: 4/8 = 50% > 44.4% → **A keeps partition 0** (enclave preserved)

## Assessment: Expected Behavior vs Bugs

### Why Enclaves Are Expected (Not Bugs)

**1. Algorithmic Design Choice**
- The 4/9 threshold is intentionally conservative to prevent partition instability
- Mirrors grid-based contiguity behavior for consistency across spatial methods
- Prevents "ping-pong" effects where polygons switch back and forth between partitions

**2. Geographic Reality Preservation**
- True geographic enclaves in FEWS NET data (islands, disconnected admin units) are naturally preserved
- Algorithm respects actual spatial relationships rather than forcing artificial contiguity

**3. Statistical Stability**
- Conservative threshold ensures partition refinement converges to stable solution
- Prevents excessive refinement that could degrade model performance

**4. Spatial Coherence**
- Small clusters of like-partitioned polygons can maintain their identity
- Preserves meaningful spatial patterns in the underlying data

### When Enclaves Might Indicate Issues

**Legitimate Concerns (Rare Cases):**
1. **Isolated Single Polygons**: Solo polygons completely surrounded by opposite partition
2. **Data Quality Issues**: Enclaves resulting from missing/incorrect adjacency relationships  
3. **Threshold Sensitivity**: User preference for more aggressive contiguity enforcement

## Decision Framework

### Do NOT "Fix" Enclaves When:
- ✅ They result from the normal 4/9 threshold operation
- ✅ They represent true geographic enclaves (islands, disconnected territories)
- ✅ They form small coherent clusters (2-3 polygons)
- ✅ They maintain algorithmic stability and performance

### Consider Intervention When:
- ⚠️ User explicitly requests more aggressive contiguity (lower threshold)
- ⚠️ Isolated single polygons cause visualization issues
- ⚠️ Adjacency matrix contains errors affecting spatial relationships

## Configuration Options for Users

### Current Conservative Configuration (Recommended)
```python
# Preserves enclaves, ensures stability
USE_ADJACENCY_MATRIX = True
# swap_partition_polygon() uses 4/9 threshold (hardcoded)
```

### Alternative Configurations (If Needed)
```python
# Option 1: More aggressive contiguity (hypothetical modification)
PARTITION_SWITCH_THRESHOLD = 0.4  # vs default 4/9 ≈ 0.444

# Option 2: Disable contiguity refinement entirely
CONTIGUITY = False
REFINE_TIMES = 0
```

## Recommendations

### For Current Production System
1. **No changes needed** - enclaves are expected behavior
2. **Continue using adjacency matrix** - provides accurate spatial relationships
3. **Document enclave behavior** for users who might question partition maps

### For Future Enhancements
1. **Make threshold configurable** - allow users to adjust conservativeness
2. **Add enclave reporting** - log count/size of enclaves for user awareness
3. **Visualization improvements** - clearly distinguish enclaves from errors in maps

### For Users Investigating Enclaves
1. **Check adjacency matrix quality** - verify shapefile accuracy
2. **Validate against geography** - compare enclaves to known geographic features
3. **Consider threshold adjustment** - only if stability is not compromised

## Conclusion

The enclave-like polygons in partition maps are **expected artifacts** of a well-designed conservative contiguity refinement algorithm. They represent the system working correctly to:

1. **Maintain spatial stability** through conservative thresholds
2. **Preserve geographic reality** including true enclaves and islands  
3. **Prevent partition instability** that could harm model performance
4. **Use accurate adjacency relationships** from FEWS NET boundaries

**Recommendation**: No fixes required. The current system appropriately balances spatial contiguity with algorithmic stability.
